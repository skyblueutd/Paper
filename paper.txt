Most important papers I have read each year since I started my computer science professional.
2017:  
Demand Response Exchange in the Stochastic Day-Ahead Scheduling with Variable Renewable Generation
 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7051232   
It is a combination of unit commitment (linear programming) and machine learning.
2018:
Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting
https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214 
I think it is going to touch the uncertainty of chaos systems
2019:
Deep Complex Networks
https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09792
It is a very simple neural network in complex numbers. I think it has more significant importance in electrical magnitude wave world rather than video/speech analysis since EM wave is a universe of complex variable functions. 
2020:
Maybe Graph Neural Networks. Letâ€™s see.
