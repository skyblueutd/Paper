# Paper
 Most important papers I have read each year since I started my computer science professional.

2016:XGboost
 https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754
It is the start of my understanding of deep learning.

2017:Demand Response Exchange in the Stochastic Day-Ahead Scheduling with Variable Renewable Generation
 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7051232   
It is a combination of unit commitment (linear programming) and machine learning.
You can find the data set here: https://github.com/MATPOWER/matpower/tree/master/data

2018:Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting
 https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214
I think it is going to touch the uncertainty of chaos systems

2019: Deep Complex Networks
 https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09792
It is a very simple neural network in complex numbers. I think it has more significant importance in electrical magnitude wave world rather than video/speech analysis since EM wave is an universe of complex variable functions. 

2020:
Maybe Graph Neural Networks. Letâ€™s see.(I want to list that covid-19 paper, let's skip this year...)

2021:Mixed Integer Programs NN. Yes, By DeepMind. 
 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13349.pdf
Compare it with MIPLIB:
 https://miplib.zib.de/
I heard it was tried to solve security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problems.

2022: ChatGPT is fantastic.
But this paper gives a review of NLP: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04655.pdf
OK, there is a GPT4! It is a provement of emergentism.

2023: Many of my old friends (professors/directors) are saying that there will be a revolution in material science after GNoME:

2024: It should be diffusion models:
There is a lot of papers and code here, https://github.com/diff-usion/Awesome-Diffusion-Models
